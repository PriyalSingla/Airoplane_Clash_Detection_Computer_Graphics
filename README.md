## OpenGL Animated Aeroplane Scene

# Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop an animated scene featuring a flying aeroplane within an OpenGL environment. The scene incorporates various elements including:
* A runway
* Buildings
* Birds
* Sky backdrop 
<br>All components are rendered using OpenGL primitives and transformations to create a cohesive and dynamic visual experience.

# How to Run:
$ gcc final.c -lGl -lGLU -lglut 
<br>$ ./.a.out

# Key Features
* Animated aeroplane trajectory
* Realistic environment elements
* Utilization of OpenGL primitives for rendering
* Implementation of transformations for object manipulation and animation

# Technical Implementation
* OpenGL Rendering
  * Use of primitives for basic shapes
  * Texture mapping for enhanced realism
* Animation
  * Keyframe animation for aeroplane movement
  * Particle systems for environmental effects
* Scene Management
  * Efficient draw calls
  * View frustum culling

# Purpose
This project serves as a demonstration of OpenGL programming skills and computer graphics principles. It showcases the ability to create complex, animated scenes using fundamental OpenGL concepts.
